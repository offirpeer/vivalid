It is also especially useful for SPAs.\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n### Consolidates Sync and Async validations\r\nSync rules return with `stateEnum.invalid` or `stateEnum.valid`  \r\nAsync rules return with `stateEnum.pending`, and also call a callback with `stateEnum.invalid` or `stateEnum.valid` when ready. Callbacks from previous cycles get filtered out, which helps when AJAX responses are out of order from multiple parallel requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo: https://embed.plnkr.co/daGXkk1RrdRxjFWhQgwX/\r\n\r\n### Full UI control \r\nEither edit the UI through a CSS rule for `.vivalid-error` and `.vivalid-error-input` classes , or gain complete control by passing a [callback](http://pazams.github.io/vivalid/documentation/-_internal.html#..onInputValidationResult) that will be called with a DOM element, validation message, and validation state.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://embed.plnkr.co/JsA852mcYTTUHPoUf3F1/\r\n\r\n### JS api or data attributes interface\r\nUse this library with full [javascript api](http://pazams.github.io/vivalid/documentation/vivalid.html), or the data attributes html interface (with js to only define callbacks).\r\n\r\nData attribute | defined on    | notes\r\n-------------- | --------------| -----\r\ndata-vivalid-group | group | defines an input group. may be applied on (but not restricted to) `<form>` elements. the value may used with [htmlInterface api](http://www.pazams.com/vivalid/documentation/vivalid.htmlInterface.html) in resetGroup.\r\ndata-vivalid-on-validation | group | references success and failure callbacks.\r\ndata-vivalid-pending-ui | group | references start and stop pending ui callbacks. used only in groups which contain async validators.\r\ndata-vivalid-after-validation | group | references before and after validation callbacks. Defined on group level, but gets called on each input individually.\r\ndata-vivalid-tuples | input | an array of [validatorsNameOptionsTuple] (http://www.pazams.com/vivalid/documentation/-_internal.html#..validatorsNameOptionsTuple) in JSON format.\r\ndata-vivalid-blur-only | input | marks an input to be evaluated on `blur` event only, as opposed to default way: first evaluated on `blur` event, and after one event, evaluate on `input` event.\r\ndata-vivalid-submit | button | triggers the group validation. Taking further action such as submitting a form, should be defined on the group's validation success callback. `preventDefault()` is applied to the DOM event. \r\ndata-vivalid-reset | button | resets the state of the validation. this does not reset the form/group or clear its contents. This functionality, through the js api, is useful for SPA's. `preventDefault()` is applied to the DOM event.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Separation of validator rules\r\nNo validator rules are included. Choose to include common ones from https://github.com/pazams/vivalid-rules-core, or write your own.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://embed.plnkr.co/Q6bTpj7PhqbQTBUZt166/\r\n\r\n### Support for radio buttons and checkboxes\r\nDemo: https://embed.plnkr.co/xtxe1YfsmxRR9hacZ3sn/\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Manual:\r\n* save and include: https://cdn.rawgit.com/pazams/vivalid/0.2.0/dist/vivalid-bundle.min.js\r\n* (optional) https://cdn.rawgit.com/pazams/vivalid-rules-core/0.2.0/dist/vivalid-rules-core-bundle.min.js\r\n\r\n### npm:\r\n* `npm install vivalid`\r\n* (optional) `npm install vivalid-rules-core`\r\n\r\n### bower:\r\n* `bower install vivalid`\r\n* (optional) `bower install vivalid-rules-core`\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nread [this](https://github.com/pazams/vivalid/issues/1) before attempting to `gulp build`\r\n",
